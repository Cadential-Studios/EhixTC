## 🚀 QUICK START FOR CODEX AI

**To begin development, start with TASK 1** (Code Organization). This is the foundation that makes all other tasks easier.

**Command sequence to start:**
```bash
git branch                    # Check current branch
git checkout develop          # Switch to development branch
git pull origin develop       # Get latest changes
# Now begin TASK 1
```

**Remember**: Always work on feature/content branches, never directly on `main`!
