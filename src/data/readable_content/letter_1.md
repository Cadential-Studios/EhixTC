### My Dearest Love,  

If your eyes are reading these words, then fate has taken me down a path I may not return from.  
The cave you now stand in may well be my tomb, or the last trace of who I was.  

**Do not let sorrow claim you.** I left not in fear, but in purpose.  
Whatever darkness awaited me, I walked into it with your name as my final whisper,  
and your love as my shield.  

Should I never return, know this:  
*I did not die alone.*  
I carried you with me—every heartbeat, every breath, every step.  

Forever yours,  
— **Silvaiah**
