# A Desperate Message

*This letter appears to have been written hastily, with ink blots and smudged words throughout.*

---

**My Dearest Friend,**

I write to you in **great haste** and with trembling hands. The situation here has grown far worse than we initially believed. What we thought were mere *rumors* of strange creatures in the forest have proven to be horrifyingly real.

## The Attacks

Three nights ago, the **Brewster farm** was attacked. Not by bandits or wolves as we first thought, but by something... *unnatural*. The livestock were found drained of blood, yet with no visible wounds. Mrs. Brewster swears she saw **glowing eyes** in the treeline, watching her from the darkness.

### What We Know

* The attacks happen only during the **new moon**
* No tracks are ever found near the scenes
* The victims show signs of *supernatural* influence
* **Local wildlife has fled** the area entirely

## A Warning

I fear these creatures will not remain content with livestock for long. The village guards are *woefully unprepared* for such threats. We have sent word to the **Temple of the Silver Light**, hoping their clerics might provide guidance or aid.

**Please, if you receive this letter, do not travel through Darkwood Pass alone.** Wait for a proper escort, or better yet, avoid the area entirely until this matter is resolved.

*Your concerned friend,*

**Marcus Thornfield**  
*Village of Millbrook*

*P.S. - I have hidden additional supplies in the old oak by Miller's Creek. Should you need them, look for the carved rune three hands up from the base.*
