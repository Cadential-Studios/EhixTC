## Inventory & Consumables

Improve inventory UI and item handling for clarity and usability.

### To-Do Items
- [x] Health potions and consumables should not have an "equip" option in the inventory UI. Add a tag to items to indicate consumables vs. equippable.
- [x] The inventory section in the inventory UI should be the same length as the equipment section for consistency.

## Menus & Navigation

Enhance in-game and meta navigation for better user experience.

### To-Do Items
- [x] Add a back button in the Origin UI to return to the main menu.
- [x] If in the main game view, the escape key should open the pause menu.
- [x] Add a pause menu with options: resume, save, load, quit to main menu.
- [x] In the pause menu, the settings button should open the settings menu.
- [x] In the pause menu, the quit button should return to the main menu (not quit the game) and prompt for confirmation if there are unsaved changes, allowing saving before quitting.
- [x] There should be a pause/play button in the main game view to pause time and allow UI interaction without time passing.

## Save/Load System

Improve save/load workflow and prevent accidental data loss.

### To-Do Items
- [x] Add a confirmation dialog when deleting save files to prevent accidental deletions.
- [x] Add confirmation to save game button to prevent accidental overwrites or saves.
- [x] Create a save menu that allows players to save their game at any time, view existing saves, see details, and delete/overwrite saves. Saves should be timestamped and show details (location, time played, character info, etc.).
- [x] Add a load menu that allows players to load existing saves with details shown.

## Journal & UI Polish

Refine journal and general UI for clarity and usability.

### To-Do Items
- [x] Refine the Journal UI to be less cluttered and more user-friendly.

## Versioning & Updates

Add update/version check from the main menu.

### To-Do Items
- [x] There should be a way to run the version.json file to check for updates from the main menu.
