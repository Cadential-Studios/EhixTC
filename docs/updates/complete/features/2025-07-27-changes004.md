- [x] Add more expansive test files in the `tests` directory.
- [x] Slot info in the details view of an item should be in common text format, not a code block. For example it should be "Slot: Main Hand" instead of "Slot: mainHand"

- [x] The text under the item name should be capitalized and formatted properly, e.g., "Weapon - Melee" instead of "Weapon - melee"

- [x] Add animations to the sliders or use a more visually appealing slider library.
- [x] Rare items should have a distinct visual style or border to indicate their status. It should be blue or whatever color is appropriate for rare items.
- [x] Epic items should be changed to Very Rare and have a distinct visual style or border to indicate their status. It should be purple or whatever color is appropriate for very rare items.
- [x] Items should follow D&D 5e rarity standards:

  - Very Rare
  - Legendary
- [x] the level up menu with the button "Continue Adventure" should be removed.
- [x] The save popup should be in the game as a modal dialog instead of a browseer alert.
