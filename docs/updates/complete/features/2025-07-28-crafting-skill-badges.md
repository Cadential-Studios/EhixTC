# 2025-07-28: Crafting UI Skill Badges & Color Consistency

## Summary
- Added rounded skill badges to the crafting recipe UI, each showing the skill name and required level.
- Each skill now has a unique, consistent badge color (using Tailwind classes) across the UI.
- Created `skillColors.js` utility for mapping skills to color classes.
- Updated `ui.js` to use badge rendering in both recipe list and details.
- Added Jest tests: `skillColors.test.js` (utility) and `crafting.test.js` (badge rendering logic).
- All new and existing tests pass.
