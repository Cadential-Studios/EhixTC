# Bug Fix Update Plan â€“ July 2025

**Completion Date:** 2025-07-27

## Overview
This document outlines the planned bug fixes and improvements for the upcoming update. Each task is described in detail to clarify the intended changes and expected outcomes.

## Tasks

### 1. Main Game Menu Layout
**Issue:** The main game menu does not utilize the full available window space, resulting in a cramped appearance. Inventory and character menus display correctly.
**Planned Fix:** Adjust the layout and CSS for the main game menu to ensure it expands to fill the entire window, providing a more immersive and visually balanced experience.

### 2. "Unknown action type: undefined" Error
**Issue:** When pressing the "Close" button in the inventory or character sheet menus, an error message "Unknown action type: undefined" appears.
**Planned Fix:** Investigate the event handling for the "Close" buttons in both menus. Ensure that the correct action type is dispatched or handled, and suppress or resolve any undefined action errors.

### 3. Developer Commands Functionality
**Issue:** Developer commands are currently not functioning as intended within the game environment.
**Planned Fix:** Review and update all developer command implementations to ensure they work correctly with the current game systems. Test each command for reliability and expected behavior.

### 4. Experience (XP) Bar Level-Up Behavior
**Issue:** When a player levels up, the XP bar remains full instead of resetting to reflect the new XP required for the next level. The player's XP value is correct, but the visual bar does not update as expected.
**Planned Fix:** Modify the XP system so that upon leveling up, the XP bar visually resets to indicate the progress toward the next level, while maintaining the correct XP value for the player.

### 5. Dice Roller Notification Timing
**Issue:** The notification displaying the dice roll result appears before the dice roll animation has completed, reducing the impact of the animation.
**Planned Fix:** Adjust the timing of the notification so that it is triggered only after the dice roll animation finishes, ensuring a smoother and more engaging user experience.

**Developer Name:**
Codex Bot

**Date of Implementation:**
2025-07-27

**Tasks Completed:**
- Fixed game menu layout to use full width (Task 1)
- Prevented "Unknown action type" error when closing panels (Task 2)
- Ensured developer commands initialize correctly (Task 3)
- XP bar now resets after leveling up (Task 4)
- Delayed dice roll notifications until animation ends (Task 5)

**Implementation Details:**
- Updated `main.css` to remove the 800px max-width restriction on `.game-container`.
- Limited action button listeners in `scenes.js` to buttons within the location panel.
- Added a return value to `detectDeveloperMode` in `developerMenu.js`.
- Reset the XP bar width in `experience.js` after level ups.
- Increased timeout values in several modules so messages wait for dice animations.

**Testing Performed:**
- Ran `npm test` (no tests defined) to verify environment.
- Observed Node and npm versions.

**Results:**
- Layout now spans full width and close buttons no longer trigger warnings.
- Developer menu can be enabled via detection return value.
- XP bar resets properly and dice notifications align with animations.

**Findings & Observations:**
- Existing code lacks automated tests which would aid verification.

**Next Steps / Recommendations:**
- Create automated test suite and linting to prevent regressions.

**Additional Notes:**
- N/A
