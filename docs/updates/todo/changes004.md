- Add more expansive test files in the `tests` directory.
- Slot info in the details view of an item should be in common text format, not a code block. For example it should be "Slot: Main Hand" instead of "Slot: mainHand"
- Rarity should be displayed in the text under the item name (where it says Weapon, Melee, etc.)
- The text under the item name should be capitalized and formatted properly, e.g., "Weapon - Melee" instead of "Weapon - melee"
- [ ] Add a "No Items" message in the inventory UI when there are no items to display.
- Add animations to the sliders or use a more visually appealing slider library.
- Rare items should have a distinct visual style or border to indicate their status. It should be blue or whatever color is appropriate for rare items.
- Epic items should be changed to Very Rare and have a distinct visual style or border to indicate their status. It should be purple or whatever color is appropriate for very rare items.
- Items should follow D&D 5e rarity standards:
  - Common
  - Uncommon
  - Rare
  - Very Rare
  - Legendary
- the level up menu with the button "Continue Adventure" should be removed.
- The save popup should be in the game as a modal dialog instead of a browseer alert.
