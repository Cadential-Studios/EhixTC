## Additions
This section covers the addition of new features and improvements to the game, focusing on UI/UX enhancements and gameplay mechanics.
### To-Do Items
#### Container Items
- [ ] Add a check when an item has the "container" property, if it does, then the item should be able to be opened in the inventory UI to view its contents. The contents will be coded in the item data as an array of items called "container_contents".
- [ ] Add the mechanic that shows a container's weight in the inventory UI, and if the container reaches its weight limit, items cannot be added to it.
- [ ] On hover over a "container" item in the inventory UI, show a tooltip with the item's name, description, and weight.


#### Clothing
- [ ] Add a clothing equipment slot to the inventory UI, allowing players to equip clothing items that provide bonuses or effects. The item must have the "Clothing" slot type in its data.
