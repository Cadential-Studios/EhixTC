## Tasks

### 1. Main Game Menu Layout
**Issue:** The main game menu does not utilize the full available window space, resulting in a cramped appearance. Inventory and character menus display correctly.
**Planned Fix:** Adjust the layout and CSS for the main game menu to ensure it expands to fill the entire window, providing a more immersive and visually balanced experience.

### 2. "Unknown action type: undefined" Error
**Issue:** When pressing the "Close" button in the inventory or character sheet menus, an error message "Unknown action type: undefined" appears.
**Planned Fix:** Investigate the event handling for the "Close" buttons in both menus. Ensure that the correct action type is dispatched or handled, and suppress or resolve any undefined action errors.

### 3. Developer Commands Functionality
**Issue:** Developer commands are currently not functioning as intended within the game environment.
**Planned Fix:** Review and update all developer command implementations to ensure they work correctly with the current game systems. Test each command for reliability and expected behavior.

### 4. Experience (XP) Bar Level-Up Behavior
**Issue:** When a player levels up, the XP bar remains full instead of resetting to reflect the new XP required for the next level. The player's XP value is correct, but the visual bar does not update as expected.
**Planned Fix:** Modify the XP system so that upon leveling up, the XP bar visually resets to indicate the progress toward the next level, while maintaining the correct XP value for the player.

### 5. Dice Roller Notification Timing
**Issue:** The notification displaying the dice roll result appears before the dice roll animation has completed, reducing the impact of the animation.
**Planned Fix:** Adjust the timing of the notification so that it is triggered only after the dice roll animation finishes, ensuring a smoother and more engaging user experience.
