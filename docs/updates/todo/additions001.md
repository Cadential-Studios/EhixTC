- remove the "Unequip" button from the equipment slot UI for items.
- Add icons to the Neck slot and the ring slots in the equipment UI.
- Have the equipment UI be a vertical line of slots, with the Helmet slot at the top, followed by the Neck slot, etc.


### Bugs
- A bug exists where, when selecting a filter in the Inventory UI, the UI for Items, Weight, Value, Free Slots, and Equipment have their width incorrectly adjusted to expand to the full width of the screen. This should be fixed so that the UI elements maintain their intended widths regardless of the filter selection.
