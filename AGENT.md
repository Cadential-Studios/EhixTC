## AI Assistant Instructions
This section is for AI and human contributors. Follow these best practices for effective collaboration:

### Communication
- Always clarify ambiguous requests before proceeding.
- Summarize your understanding of the task before making major changes.
- Use markdown formatting for code, file paths, and important notes.

### Code Review & Quality
- Suggest improvements and refactoring where appropriate.
- Point out potential bugs, edge cases, or performance issues.
- Ensure all code is commented and easy to follow.

### Documentation
- Update relevant markdown files in `docs/` for new features, bug fixes, or system changes.
- Use the Implementation Results Log template for all completed tasks.

### Testing
- Propose and document test cases for new features or bug fixes.
- Encourage manual and automated testing, especially for critical systems.

### Collaboration
- Respect the branch workflow and never commit directly to `main` (except for documentation).
- When in doubt, ask for clarification or suggest alternatives.


### üî¥ FIRST PRIORITY: BRANCH CHECK
**Before assisting with ANY code changes:**
1. Remind user to check current branch with `git branch` or `git status`.
2. Suggest the most appropriate branch for the requested task (feature, bugfix, content, etc.).
3. Confirm the user has switched to the correct branch before proceeding.
4. Never assist with changes on `main` branch (except for documentation updates).

### When Asked to Add Content

#### Adding New Locations
1. Edit `data/locations.json`
2. Follow the JSON structure above
3. Include proper image paths in `assets/images/locations/`
4. Add appropriate actions with correct types

#### Adding New Story Scenes
1. Edit `data/scenes.json`
2. Include proper scene flow and choices
3. Use onEnter for quest/lore triggers
4. Ensure scene IDs are unique

#### Adding New Items/Equipment
1. Edit `data/items.json`
2. Include all required properties
3. Balance stats appropriately
4. Consider rarity and value

#### Adding New Quests
1. Edit `data/quests.json`
2. Include objectives and rewards
3. Link to appropriate scenes/locations
4. Consider quest types (main, side, milestone)

### When Asked to Modify Styling
1. Edit `assets/css/main.css`
2. Maintain existing color scheme and theme
3. Use CSS custom properties where appropriate
4. Ensure responsive design principles

### When Asked to Add Game Logic
1. Edit `assets/js/main.js`
2. Follow existing code patterns
3. Use async/await for data loading
4. Maintain separation of concerns


### Code Style Guidelines
Maintain a clean, readable, and consistent codebase. Use the following conventions:

#### JavaScript
- Use ES6+ features (const/let, arrow functions, async/await)
- Follow camelCase naming convention
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment complex logic

#### CSS
- Use BEM-like naming for custom classes
- Maintain existing color palette
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Use Tailwind classes where appropriate

#### JSON
- Use snake_case for IDs
- Include all required fields
- Maintain consistent structure
- Validate JSON syntax


### Common Tasks & Solutions
Refer to these patterns for frequent requests. When implementing new features, always check for similar existing solutions first.

#### Adding a New Location
1. Add entry to `data/locations.json`
2. Create corresponding image in `assets/images/locations/`
3. Link from existing locations or scenes
4. Test navigation

#### Creating New Story Branch
1. Add scenes to `data/scenes.json`
2. Link choices between scenes
3. Add quest/lore triggers as needed
4. Update character progression

#### Implementing New Game Feature
1. Add data structure to appropriate JSON file
2. Update `assets/js/main.js` with logic
3. Add styling to `assets/css/main.css` if needed
4. Test thoroughly


### File Modification Priority
Prioritize changes that impact content and player experience. Avoid unnecessary changes to core structure unless required.
1. **High Priority**: JSON data files (content changes)
2. **Medium Priority**: CSS/JS files (functionality/styling)
3. **Low Priority**: HTML structure (only for major changes)


### Testing Guidelines
Testing is critical for game stability. Always:
- Test in multiple browsers and on mobile/desktop.
- Validate JSON and check for JavaScript errors.
- Test save/load and edge cases for new features.
- Always test in browser after changes
- Verify JSON syntax with validator
- Check console for JavaScript errors
- Test on mobile/desktop viewports
- Verify save/load functionality


### Git Workflow & Branch Management
Follow these steps for all code contributions. AI assistants should always remind users of these steps before major changes.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: ALWAYS CHECK/SWITCH BRANCH BEFORE STARTING WORK
Before making ANY changes, always:
1. Check current branch: `git branch` or `git status`
2. Switch to appropriate branch: `git checkout [branch-name]`
3. Pull latest changes: `git pull origin [branch-name]`

#### Development Branch Strategy
- **NEVER develop directly on `main`** - main is for production-ready code only
- Use `develop` branch for general integration work
- Use specific feature/content branches for focused development
- Create new branches from `develop`, not `main`

#### Available Branches:
**Feature Branches:**
- `feature/story-expansion` - New story content, scenes, dialogue
- `feature/combat-system` - Combat mechanics implementation
- `feature/inventory-system` - Item management and equipment
- `feature/save-load-system` - Save/load functionality
- `feature/quest-system` - Quest tracking and management
- `feature/world-map` - Interactive map and travel
- `feature/character-progression` - Leveling, stats, skills
- `feature/audio-system` - Sound effects and music
- `feature/ui-improvements` - UI/UX enhancements
- `feature/moon-mechanics` - Moon phase gameplay effects

**Content Branches:**
- `content/locations` - New areas and environments
- `content/characters-npcs` - NPCs and character interactions
- `content/items-equipment` - New items, weapons, equipment

**Other Branches:**
- `develop` - Main development integration
- `hotfix/bug-fixes` - Critical bug fixes
- `release/v1.0` - Release preparation

#### Quick Branch Commands:
```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# Switch to development branch
git checkout develop

# Switch to feature branch
git checkout feature/story-expansion

# Create and switch to new branch from develop
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# See all branches
git branch -a
```

#### Standard Git Workflow:
1. **Check current branch** before starting work
2. Switch to appropriate branch for the task
3. Pull latest changes
4. Make your changes
5. Test thoroughly
6. Commit with descriptive messages
7. Push to remote branch
8. Create pull request to merge into `develop`


## Important Notes
These rules help prevent common mistakes and maintain project integrity. AI assistants should enforce these guidelines and remind users as needed.


## Task Completion & Documentation Workflow
Proper documentation and task tracking are essential for project transparency and future maintenance. Use the following workflow for all features, bug fixes, and improvements.


### Managing TODO Documents
- Track all planned features, bug fixes, and improvements as markdown documents in the `docs/todo/` directory, organized by category (e.g., `features`, `bugs`, `other`).
- Each TODO document must clearly describe the tasks, issues, and planned solutions, with enough detail for any developer or AI to understand and implement.
- Upon completion, update the document status, add a completion date at the top, and move it to the appropriate `complete` subfolder (e.g., `docs/todo/bugs/complete/`).
- If follow-up actions are required, create a new TODO document and link it from the completed one.


### Implementation Results Log
Every TODO document must include the Implementation Results Log below. This ensures all work is documented, reviewed, and traceable. Fill it out in detail before moving a document to `complete`.

#### Implementation Results Log Template
```
